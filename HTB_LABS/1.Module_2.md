# HTML

The first and most dominant component of the front end of web applications is **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**. HTML is at the very core of any web page we see on the internet. It contains each page's basic elements, including titles, forms, images, and many other elements. The web browser interprets these elements and displays them to the end-user.

## Basic HTML Example

The following is a very basic example of an HTML page:


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

## Output

- Page title: Page Title

- URL: www.example.com

- Heading: A Heading

- Paragraph: A Paragraph

## HTML Structure (Tree View)
HTML elements are displayed in a tree structure, similar to XML:

    
    HTML document
     └── html
         ├── head
         │   └── title
         └── body
             ├── h1
             └── p

Each element can contain other HTML elements. The main <html> tag contains all page elements and exists under the document, distinguishing HTML from other document types such as XML.

## HTML Elements Explained
The elements from the example above can be represented as:

    html
    Copy code
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

Each HTML element consists of:

- Opening tag

- Content

- Closing tag

### Example

    <p>A Paragraph</p>

Tags may also contain attributes such as id or class:

    <p id="para1">Example paragraph</p>
    <p class="red-paragraphs">Another paragraph</p>

The tag and its content together form a complete HTML element.

## URL Encoding
URL Encoding (also called percent-encoding) is an important concept in HTML.

- Browsers can only use ASCII characters in URLs

- Non-ASCII characters must be encoded

- Unsafe characters are replaced with % followed by two hexadecimal digits


### Examples

-  ' → %27

- Space → + or %20

## Common URL Encodings

    Character            	Encoding
    space	                %20
    !	                    %21
    "	                    %22
    #	                    %23
    $                    	%24
    %                    	%25
    &	                    %26
    '                    	%27
    (                    	%28
    )                    	%29

A full URL encoding table can be found online.

Many tools can perform URL encoding and decoding, including online encoders and Burp Suite, which provides built-in encoding and decoding features.

## Usage of HTML Elements

    <head>
Contains metadata not directly displayed on the page (e.g. title, styles, scripts).

    <body>
Contains visible page content.

Other important elements include:

- <style> – contains CSS code

- <script> – contains JavaScript code

### Document Object Model (DOM)

Each HTML element is part of the Document Object Model (DOM).

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines the DOM as:

“The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.”

## DOM Standards
The DOM is divided into three main parts:

- Core DOM – Standard model for all document types

- XML DOM – Standard model for XML documents

- HTML DOM – Standard model for HTML documents

From the tree structure, elements can be referenced as:


    document.head
    document.body
    document.h1

## Why DOM Understanding Matters
Understanding the HTML DOM structure helps to:

- Locate elements in source code

- Debug layout and rendering issues

- Identify elements by:

    - id
    - class name


# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the stylesheet language used alongside HTML to format and style HTML elements. Like HTML, CSS has multiple versions, and each new version introduces additional capabilities for styling web pages. Web browsers are updated to support these new features as they are introduced.

---

## Example

At a fundamental level, CSS is used to define the style of each class or type of HTML element (e.g., `body` or `h1`). Any element on the page that matches a rule will be styled according to the CSS definition.

This can include:

- Font family  
- Font size  
- Background color  
- Text color  
- Text alignment  
- And more  

### CSS Code Example


        body {
          background-color: black;
        }
        
        h1 {
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
        }
        
        p {
          font-family: helvetica;
          font-size: 10px;
        }

As previously mentioned, this is why unique IDs or class names are often assigned to HTML elements—so they can later be referenced in CSS or JavaScript.

## Syntax
CSS defines the style of HTML elements or classes using curly brackets {}. Inside these brackets, properties are assigned values:


        element {
          property: value;
        }

Each HTML element has many properties that can be styled using CSS, such as:

- height,position,border,margin,padding,color,text-align,font-size

There are hundreds of available properties that can be combined to design visually appealing web pages.,Animations

CSS can also be used for advanced animations, ranging from simple movements to complex 3D effects. Common animation-related properties include:

- @keyframes,animation,animation-duration,animation-direction

These properties allow developers to create smooth and visually engaging animations without relying solely on JavaScript.

## Usage
CSS is often used alongside JavaScript to:

Perform quick calculations

Dynamically update style properties


This demonstrates that even though HTML and CSS are foundational web technologies, they can be used to build visually stunning and highly interactive web applications.

Extended Use Cases
CSS can also be used:

With other markup languages such as XML

Inside SVG elements

In modern mobile development platforms to design complete mobile application User Interfaces (UI)

## Frameworks
Some developers find CSS difficult or inefficient to manage at scale, especially when styling large applications. To address this, many CSS frameworks have been created. These frameworks provide pre-built stylesheets and components to speed up development.

CSS frameworks are typically:

Optimized for web applications

Designed to work seamlessly with JavaScript

Equipped with common UI components used in modern applications

Popular CSS Frameworks

- Bootstrap

- SASS

- Foundation

- Bulma

- Pure



# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is primarily used in web and mobile development. JavaScript is commonly executed on the **front end** of applications within the web browser, but it is also used on the **back end** through environments such as **Node.js**, enabling the development of full-stack web applications.

While **HTML** and **CSS** define the structure and appearance of a web page, **JavaScript** controls its functionality and interactivity. Without JavaScript, most web pages would be largely static and offer minimal user interaction.

---

## Example

Within a web page, JavaScript code is loaded using the `<script>` tag:


    <script type="text/javascript">
      // JavaScript code
    </script>

A web page can also load external JavaScript files using the src attribute:


    <script src="./script.js"></script>

- Basic JavaScript Example

        document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";

This example changes the content of the HTML element with the ID button1. When connected to a button click event, the text of the button dynamically updates based on user interaction.

As with HTML and CSS, there are many online platforms available to experiment with JavaScript. One popular example is JSFiddle, which allows developers to test and save JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code snippets.

JavaScript is a powerful and advanced language, and its syntax is more complex than HTML or CSS.

## Usage

Most common web applications heavily rely on JavaScript to drive all needed functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real-time, dynamically updating content in real-time, accepting and processing user input, and many other potential functionalities.

JavaScript is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with back-end systems using technologies such as AJAX.

In addition, JavaScript is frequently used alongside CSS to create advanced animations that are not possible with CSS alone. Highly interactive and visually dynamic web pages are driven by JavaScript executing in the browser.

All modern web browsers include JavaScript engines capable of executing JavaScript code on the client side without requiring communication with the back-end server, making JavaScript fast and efficient for many tasks.

## Frameworks
As web applications become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pure JavaScript to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of JavaScript frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

These platforms introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities, like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changing HTML code, instead of using static HTML code.

These platforms either use JavaScript as their programming language or use an implementation of JavaScript that compiles its code into JavaScript code.

Some of the most common front end JavaScript frameworks are:

- Angular

- React

- Vue

- jQuery


# Sensitive Data Exposure
All of the front end components we covered are interacted with on the client-side. Therefore, if they are attacked, they do not pose a direct threat to the core back end of the web application and usually will not lead to permanent damage. However, as these components are executed on the client-side, they put the end-user in danger of being attacked and exploited if they do have any vulnerabilities. If a front end vulnerability is leveraged to attack admin users, it could result in unauthorized access, access to sensitive data, service disruption, and more.

Although the majority of web application penetration testing is focused on back end components and their functionality, it is important also to test front end components for potential vulnerabilities, as these types of vulnerabilities can sometimes be utilized to gain access to sensitive functionality (i.e., an admin panel), which may lead to compromising the entire server.

Sensitive Data Exposure refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end-user. This is usually found in the source code of the web page or page source on the front end of web applications. This is the HTML source code of the application, not to be confused with the back end code that is typically only accessible on the server itself. We can view any website's page source in our browser by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting View Page Source from the pop-up menu. Sometimes a developer may disable right-clicking on a web application, but this does not prevent us from viewing the page source as we can merely type ctrl + u or view the page source through a web proxy such as Burp Suite. Let's take a look at the google.com page source. Right-click and choose View Page Source, and a new tab will open in our browser with the URL view-source:https://www.google.com/. Here we can see the HTML, JavaScript, and external links. Take a moment to browse the page source a bit.
