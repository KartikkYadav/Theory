# HTML

The first and most dominant component of the front end of web applications is **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**. HTML is at the very core of any web page we see on the internet. It contains each page's basic elements, including titles, forms, images, and many other elements. The web browser interprets these elements and displays them to the end-user.

## Basic HTML Example

The following is a very basic example of an HTML page:


    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

## Output

- Page title: Page Title

- URL: www.example.com

- Heading: A Heading

- Paragraph: A Paragraph

## HTML Structure (Tree View)
HTML elements are displayed in a tree structure, similar to XML:

    
    HTML document
     └── html
         ├── head
         │   └── title
         └── body
             ├── h1
             └── p

Each element can contain other HTML elements. The main <html> tag contains all page elements and exists under the document, distinguishing HTML from other document types such as XML.

## HTML Elements Explained
The elements from the example above can be represented as:

    html
    Copy code
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>A Heading</h1>
            <p>A Paragraph</p>
        </body>
    </html>

Each HTML element consists of:

- Opening tag

- Content

- Closing tag

### Example

    <p>A Paragraph</p>

Tags may also contain attributes such as id or class:

    <p id="para1">Example paragraph</p>
    <p class="red-paragraphs">Another paragraph</p>

The tag and its content together form a complete HTML element.

## URL Encoding
URL Encoding (also called percent-encoding) is an important concept in HTML.

- Browsers can only use ASCII characters in URLs

- Non-ASCII characters must be encoded

- Unsafe characters are replaced with % followed by two hexadecimal digits


### Examples

-  ' → %27

- Space → + or %20

## Common URL Encodings

    Character            	Encoding
    space	                %20
    !	                    %21
    "	                    %22
    #	                    %23
    $                    	%24
    %                    	%25
    &	                    %26
    '                    	%27
    (                    	%28
    )                    	%29

A full URL encoding table can be found online.

Many tools can perform URL encoding and decoding, including online encoders and Burp Suite, which provides built-in encoding and decoding features.

## Usage of HTML Elements

    <head>
Contains metadata not directly displayed on the page (e.g. title, styles, scripts).

    <body>
Contains visible page content.

Other important elements include:

- <style> – contains CSS code

- <script> – contains JavaScript code

### Document Object Model (DOM)

Each HTML element is part of the Document Object Model (DOM).

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) defines the DOM as:

“The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document.”

## DOM Standards
The DOM is divided into three main parts:

- Core DOM – Standard model for all document types

- XML DOM – Standard model for XML documents

- HTML DOM – Standard model for HTML documents

From the tree structure, elements can be referenced as:


    document.head
    document.body
    document.h1

## Why DOM Understanding Matters
Understanding the HTML DOM structure helps to:

- Locate elements in source code

- Debug layout and rendering issues

- Identify elements by:

    - id
    - class name
