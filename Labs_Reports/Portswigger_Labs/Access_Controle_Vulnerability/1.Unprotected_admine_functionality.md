# 🧪 Lab: Unprotected Admin Functionality

## Category
**Access Control / Broken Access Control**

---

## Objective
Access the admin panel without authentication and delete the user **carlos**.

---

## Application Behavior (Recon)
- Application exposes an **admin panel** at a predictable endpoint.
- No authentication or authorization checks are enforced.
- Any user (even unauthenticated) can access admin functionality.


## Discovered endpoint: /admin
Access: Public (no login required)

## Vulnerability Explanation
The application fails to enforce server-side access control on sensitive administrative endpoints.
Security is assumed through obscurity (hidden URL), which is ineffective.

This allows attackers to:

- Access admin panels

- Perform privileged actions

- Delete or modify user accounts

## Exploitation Steps

### Step 1: Discover Admin Panel
Checked common admin paths:

    /admin

### Step 2: Access Admin Panel

- Navigated directly to /admin

- Admin dashboard loaded without authentication

### Step 3: Perform Privileged Action

- Used admin interface to delete user:

      carlos

## Payload / Request Used

    GET /admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: vulnerable-site.com

    POST /admin/delete?username=carlos

## Evidence (Lab Solved)

- Admin panel accessible without login

- User carlos successfully deleted

- Lab completion message displayed

## Impact

- Full administrative takeover

- Account deletion

- Data manipulation

- Privilege escalation

Severity: 🔴 High / Critical

## Mitigation / Fix

- Enforce server-side authorization checks

- Restrict admin endpoints to authorized roles only

- Use authentication middleware

- Do not rely on hidden URLs

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)

## Key Takeaways

- Hidden endpoints ≠ secure endpoints

- Access control must be enforced server-side

- Always test for direct access to sensitive paths

- Broken access control is a top OWASP vulnerability
